# Linkedin Bot

This project is a Linkedin bot that automates the process of sending connection requests, withdrawing sent requests using Selenium.

## TL;DR
`run_cron_job.sh` script sets up a cron job to run the bot daily at random times between the 07:00 AM and 9:59 PM. The bot sends connection requests to Linkedin users. It finds users by searching for a company/university taken from `org/orgs.csv` file.
The file must have: `org_name` columns. The bot will stop when the daily set limit is reached or the linkedin weekly one is reached. 

## Features

- Send connection requests to Linkedin users.
- Find users from company/university inside `orgs.csv` file.
- Each company/university can be selected once every 2 months.
- Withdraw sent connection requests.
- Handle Linkedin login, including captcha and email/phone verification.
- Send email notifications for errors and connection limits.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Google Chrome
- ChromeDriver

### Right Away Execution
1. For sending connection requests:
    ```bash
    python main_connections.py
    ```

2. For withdrawing pending connection requests:
    ```bash
    python main_withdraw.py
    ```

## Executable Files Explanation

./run_connections_bot.sh

# Viewing logs
tail -f logs/run_connections_bot.log
```

- Sets up a cron job to run the python script daily at random times between `current_time` and 9:59 PM

### Cron Job Setup Script (run_cron_job.sh)

The `run_cron_job.sh` script handles the initial setup and configuration of the bot's automated execution. Here are its key components:

#### Directory Structure Setup
- Creates required directories for logs and configuration
- Sets up logrotate configuration directory
- Establishes proper permissions and ownership

#### Log Rotation Configuration
- Creates logrotate configuration file
- Sets monthly rotation schedule
- Configures log compression
- Sets maximum log size to 10MB
- Preserves 2 rotations of log history

#### Environment Management

- Validates environment setup before proceeding

#### Cron Job Configuration
- Removes existing bot-related cron jobs
- Configures two primary cron tasks:
  1. Log rotation task (daily at midnight)
  2. Bot execution task (daily at 7 AM)
- Includes comprehensive logging of cron job execution
- Captures environment details and Python configuration

#### Virtual Environment Integration
- Detects and uses the appropriate virtual environment
- Supports multiple environment types:
  - Conda environments
  - Python virtualenv
  - Poetry environments
- Ensures correct Python interpreter selection

#### Execution Verification
- Validates cron job installation

### Troubleshooting

1. Chromedriver Issues
   - Ensure Chrome and Chromedriver versions match
   - Verify Chromedriver path in `.env`
   - Check Chrome installation

2. Email Authentication
   - Verify email credentials in `.env`
   - Enable less secure app access for Gmail
   - Use app-specific passwords if 2FA is enabled

3. Connection Issues
   - Check internet connection
   - Verify LinkedIn credentials
   - Ensure proxy settings if using one

4. Cron Job Problems
   - Check crontab entries: `crontab -l`
   - Verify script permissions
   - Check log files in `logs/` directory

### Maintenance

1. Log Rotation
   - Logs are automatically rotated monthly
   - Keeps 2 rotations
   - Compresses old logs
   - Maximum log size: 10MB

2. Clean Up
   - Old screenshots are automatically deleted
   - Temporary files are removed after use
   - Weekly/daily limit files are managed automatically

### Security Considerations

1. Credentials
   - Store sensitive data in `.env` file
   - Never commit credentials to version control
   - Use environment variables for secrets

2. Rate Limiting
   - Respects LinkedIn's connection limits
   - Implements random delays between actions
   - Stops automatically when limits are reached

3. Detection Prevention
   - Uses stealth mode
   - Implements human-like behavior
   - Randomizes actions and delays

## Usage

### Manual Usage

1. Make the script executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x run_cron_job.sh
    ```

2. Run the setup script:
    ```bash
    ./run_cron_job.sh

    tail -f logs/linkedin.log
    ```

This will:
- Create necessary directories for logs
- Set up log rotation
- Configure and install a cron job to run daily at 7:00 AM
- `run_cron_job.sh` cron job will execute the `run_connections_bot.sh` script
- `run_connections_bot.sh` will set another cron job to run the bot daily at random times between the 7:00 AM and 9:59 PM
- `run_connections_bot.sh` cron job will execute the `main_connections.py` script

## Configuration

### Connection Request Settings
- `MAX_REQUESTS_PER_DAY`: Maximum number of connection requests per day (default: 24)
- `MIN_REQUESTS_PER_DAY`: Minimum number of connection requests per day (default: 15)
- `MIN_CONNECTIONS_PENDING`: Minimum number of pending connections active (won't go below) (default: 300)

### Bot Behavior
- `WAITING_BEFORE_CHECK`: Time to wait between checks for the captcha email response in seconds (default: 40)
- `HEADLESS`: Run Chrome in headless mode (default: True)
- `TOTAL_SCROLL_TIMES`: Number of times to scroll through people search (default: 20). In companies/universities alumni/people section there is a scrollable page with profiles. This settings limits the total scroll down, which means the number of profiles explored in that company/university.
-  `PAGES_BEFORE_QUIT`: Number of pages to search for connectable people before quitting (default: 30)
-  `MAX_WEBDRIVER_WAIT_TIME`: Maximum time to wait for a page element to load (default: 10). 
-  `MIN_WEBDRIVER_WAIT_TIME`: Minimum time to wait for a page element to load (default: 5)
   the final wait time is a random number between `MIN_WEBDRIVER_WAIT_TIME` and `MAX_WEBDRIVER_WAIT_TIME`. `WebDriverWait` function uses it.
-  `CHROMEDRIVER_PATH`: Path to the ChromeDriver executable (default: /usr/local/bin/chromedriver)
-  `BOT_VENV_NAME`: Name of the virtual environment (default: linkedin)
