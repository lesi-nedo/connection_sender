# LinkedIn Connection Bot

An advanced LinkedIn automation bot that handles connection requests, connection withdrawals, and various security challenges using Selenium WebDriver.

## Key Features

- Send connection requests with smart paging and retry logic
- Withdraw pending connection requests with configurable thresholds
- Handle LinkedIn security features:
  - Email verification codes
  - Phone number verification
  - CAPTCHA challenges
  - Security checkpoints
- Smart rate limiting and daily request caps
- Automatic log rotation
- Email notifications for events and errors
- Human-like mouse movements and delays
- Headless operation support

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Google Chrome
- ChromeDriver (compatible with Chrome version)
- Xvfb (for headless operation)
- SMTP access (Gmail recommended)
- IMAP access for email verification

## Installation

1. Clone and setup virtual environment:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/linkedin-bot.git
   cd linkedin-bot
   ```

2. Install Google Chrome:

   ```bash
   wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
   sudo apt-get install -y ./google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
   ```

3. Check the version of the installed Google Chrome:

   ```bash
   google-chrome --version
   ```

4. Download the compatible ChromeDriver version from [here](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/) and extract the file:

   ```bash
   wget https://edgedl.me.gvt1.com/edgedl/chrome/chrome-for-testing/YOUR_VERSION_NUMBER/linux64/chromedriver-linux64.zip
   unzip chromedriver-linux64.zip
   sudo mv chromedriver-linux64/chromedriver /usr/local/bin/
   ```

5. Install a virtual display for running Chrome in headless mode:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install -y xvfb
   ```

6. Create a Python virtual environment and activate it:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

7. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

8. Create a 

.env

 file in the root directory with the following variables:

   ```env
   # LinkedIn credentials
   LINKEDIN_USER_MAIL=your_linkedin_email
   LINKEDIN_PASS=your_linkedin_password

   # Email settings for sending notifications
   SENDER=your_email
   SENDER_PASS=your_email_password
   RECEIVER=receiver_email
   SMTP_SERVER_SENDER=smtp.gmail.com
   SMTP_PORT_SENDER=465

   # Email server settings for LinkedIn verification code
   EMAIL_SERVER_HOST_LINKEDIN=imap.gmail.com
   LINKEDIN_MAILBOX_PASS=your_linkedin_email_password
   LINKEDIN_INBOX_FOLDER=INBOX
   EMAIL_LINKEDIN_CODE=security-noreply@linkedin.com

   # Other settings
   WAITING_BEFORE_CHECK=40
   HEADLESS=True
   MAX_REQUESTS_PER_DAY=5
   MIN_CONNECTIONS_PENDING=300
   CHROMEDRIVER_PATH=/usr/local/bin/chromedriver
   BOT_VENV_NAME=linkedin
   ```

   **Note:** If using Gmail, you may need to generate an app password for `SENDER_PASS`. See [this guide](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833) for more information.

### Usage

1. Run the bot:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. The bot will start sending connection requests. If an error occurs, it will send an email notification and close the browser.

### Customization

- Modify the `main.py` file to change the bot's behavior.
- Adjust the settings in the 

.env

 file to match your requirements.

### Logging

Logs are generated using the 

logger

 module and can be found in the log files created in the project directory.

### Cron Job Setup

To automate the bot to run at specific intervals, you can set up a cron job using the 

run_cron_job.sh

 script.

1. Make the script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x run_cron_job.sh
   ```

2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   ./run_cron_job.sh
   ```

This will set up a cron job to run the bot at 9:00 AM daily.

### Troubleshooting

- Ensure that all environment variables are correctly set in the 

.env

 file.
- Make sure that ChromeDriver is compatible with your installed version of Google Chrome.
- Check the log files for detailed error messages.
- If you encounter login issues, verify that your LinkedIn credentials are correct and that your account is not locked.
